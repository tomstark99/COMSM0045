# Lab 1

Today we'll set up you machine for access to BC4 and introduce you to PyTorch and the basics of deep learning.

First open up the [BC4 setup notebook](./bc4-setup.ipynb) and follow the instructions to set up your computer for access to BC4.
Once you have done that and successfully run the `train_mnist.py` script on BC4 you can move onto the [lab notebook](./lab-1-dnns.ipynb)
